This is done using the up-arrow format specification. Every cell in a tableau table can have one or more format specifications. They must immediately follow the cell's opening pipe, with no intervening spaces. The valid format specifications are: ^ Merge this cell with the one above it. Multiple cells in a column may be merged { Merge this cell with the one to its left. Multiple cells in a row may be merged < Left align this cell = Center this cell > Right align this cell # Make this cell a header (use <th> ) .class Apply the CSS class to this cell The two span specifications ( ^ and { ) must appear alone (as the cell formatting is taken from the cell above or to the left). Otherwise, a format specification can contain an optional alignment specifier, an optional heading specifier, and zero or more class specifiers. These three types of specifier can appear in any order: |<#.warn.big Note |.info> Meaning | The first cell is a left-aligned heading cell with the CSS classes warn and big , while the second is a right-aligned cell with the class info . Propagating Formats Along a Row Any format specification can be followed by an ellipsis (either three periods ... or a Unicode ellipsis, \u2026 ). This format will then be propagated as a default to subsequent cells in the same row. For example, a tableau header row can be created using: |# Country |# Region |# Minimum Nos. |# Probably Nos. |# Speculative Nos. | | ... | Country Region Minimum Nos. Probably Nos. Speculative Nos. ... You can also use the heading specifier on just the first column, and use an ellipsis to propagate it. |#\u2026 Country |Region |Minimum Nos. |Probably Nos. |Speculative Nos. | | ... | Country Region Minimum Nos. Probably Nos. Speculative Nos. ... The propagated format is just a default: it can be overridden in any subsequent cell. |#...>... Animal 1 | Animal 1 | Animal 1 | Animal 1 | Animal 1 | |>... ant | bee |<cat | dog | elk | Animal 1 Animal 1 Animal 1 Animal 1 Animal 1 ant bee cat dog elk You can even override it in the cell that initially propagates it: |#...>... Animal 1 | Animal 1 | Animal 1 | Animal 1 | Animal 1 | |>...< ant | bee |<cat | dog | elk | Animal 1 Animal 1 Animal 1 Animal 1 Animal 1 ant bee cat dog elk Propagating Formats Down a Column Any tableau row that starts |: is a format row.

You can specify the sme thing using tableau format specifiers: |#...

India Northern 750 875 1,000 India Northeastern 7,200 9,250 11,300 Nepal 41 50 60 By moving the format line above the header, you can align it, too: |:< |< |>... | | | |#...
